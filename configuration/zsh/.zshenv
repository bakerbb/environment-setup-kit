# .zshenv - Zsh Environment Configuration File
#
# This file is sourced by Zsh every time it starts, regardless of whether it is
# an interactive shell or a non-interactive shell. It is used to set up the
# default environment for Zsh and to define global shell configurations and
# variables that are needed for all shell sessions.
#
# The .zshenv file is a suitable place for configurations that should be applied
# to all instances of the shell, including:
# - Setting global environment variables that are needed by various programs or scripts.
# - Defining paths and directories that are used by multiple shell sessions.
# - Configuring shell options and settings that should be applied universally.
#
# Note: Avoid adding configurations that are specific to interactive shell sessions
#       or login shell sessions to this file. Those should be added to .zshrc or
#       .zprofile files, respectively.
