# .zprofile - Zsh Profile Configuration File
#
# This file is sourced by Zsh when it starts as a login shell. It is typically
# used to configure environment variables, set up the shell environment, and
# execute commands or scripts that need to run once when you log in.
#
# You can add various types of configurations to this file, such as:
# - Setting the PATH variable to include custom directories or programs.
# - Defining environment variables needed by various applications or tools.
# - Configuring shell options and settings for the login shell.
# - Running initialization scripts or commands that need to be executed at login.
#
# Note: Avoid adding configurations that are specific to interactive shell sessions
#       or non-login shell sessions to this file. Those should be added to .zshrc
#       or .zshenv files, respectively.
